# rsa-zero

We deterministically generate valid but useless RSA keys.

Each key is generated by using a pseudo random number generator as the entropy source and it's key size as the `seed`.

**WARNING:** Do not use these keys in production.

### Build

You can regenerate the keys yourself, by running:

```
go run generate.go
```

or

```
go build . && ./rsa-zero
```

### SHAs

Below you'll find each private key's SHA1 hash
